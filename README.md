# easyScript

A simple beginner programming language meant to teach the basics of coding.

## Installation

_You must have python3 installed_

### Mac

Currently, only macOS is supported fir the quick install as that is what I am developing on. You can manually download the files here and add them to the PATH if you are on Windows or Linux.

Copy this command and paste it in your terminal to install easyScript.

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KirillMcQ/easyScript/master/installation/install_script.sh | bash
```
